# tabble-soccer-league
Tabble soccer tournament web app.

## What?

This app aims to make organizing tabble soccer events much easier. The initial idea is to have a place where I can easily create tabble soccer tournament within my company and track results. However, this could be extended track players' records, rank, etc. Also having a directory of players it is much easier finding volunteers for practice. Slack integration could be provided if anyone would find it useful.

## Why?

Because I like playing tabble soccer and I need a hobby project to practice Clojure.

## How?

The project is built using standard Clojure libraries such as ring and compojure.
